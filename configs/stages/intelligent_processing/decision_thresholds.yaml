# Decision Thresholds for Intelligent Frame Processing
# Adjust these values to tune strategy selection behavior

thresholds:
  # Background complexity threshold (0-1)
  # Lower values = simpler backgrounds preferred for keep_full
  simple_background: 0.3

  # Lighting quality threshold (0-1)
  # Higher values = better lighting required for keep_full
  good_lighting: 0.7

  # Occlusion level threshold (0-1)
  # Lower values = less occlusion acceptable for keep_full
  low_occlusion: 0.2

  # Instance count threshold
  # >= this number triggers segment strategy
  multi_character: 2

  # Quality score threshold (0-1)
  # Below this triggers enhance_segment strategy
  poor_quality: 0.5

  # Sharpness threshold (0-1)
  # Below this triggers enhancement
  low_sharpness: 0.4

# Strategy target proportions (soft targets, not strict)
strategy_targets:
  keep_full: 0.30        # 30% keep complete frames
  segment: 0.40          # 40% segment and inpaint
  create_occlusion: 0.15 # 15% create synthetic occlusions
  enhance_segment: 0.15  # 15% enhance then segment

# Dataset augmentation needs (updated dynamically)
dataset_needs:
  occlusion: 0.8      # Need occlusion examples (0-1, higher = more need)
  multi_character: 0.9 # Need multi-character scenes
  far_shot: 0.7       # Need distant/wide shots
  complex_bg: 0.6     # Need complex backgrounds
